# Portfolio
This project underwent extreme design changes during development. Initially starting as a two-column webpage, I found that I was doing something extremely complicated for really no benefit. Once simplified, I had something that worked better, felt better, and looked much, much better. This is a portfolio where I will be posting my projects here over time, so be sure to check in every now and again.
